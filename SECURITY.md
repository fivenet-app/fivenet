# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

Please note that only the latest minor release version will be supported, example:

Version `v2025.5.3` is the current latest release in this example.

| Version      | Supported?         |
| ------------ | ------------------ |
| `v2024.12.3` | :x:                |
| `v2025.1.0`  | :x:                |
| `v2025.5.0`  | :white_check_mark: |
| `v2025.5.3`  | :white_check_mark: |

`v2025.5.x` releases will be supported until the next minor release `v2025.6.x` is released.

Still should you be running an older patch release, you should consider upgrading to the latest patch release of the current minor version (e.g., `v2025.5.1` â†’ `v2025.5.3`).
